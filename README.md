# token-sniper

A Discord bot that snipes Discord bot tokens from chat. It uploads them to Gist
so that Discord's system can automatically invalidate them.

Every token that has been sniped is available
[here](https://gist.github.com/apachebot).

This is only here for educational purposes. I will not help you set it up.
